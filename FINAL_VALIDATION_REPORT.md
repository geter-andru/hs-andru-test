**Location**: Multiple authentication files
```typescript
if (customerId === 'dru78DR9789SDF862' && accessToken === 'admin-demo-token-2025')
```
- **Issue**: Static admin credentials in code
- **Risk**: Unauthorized admin access
- **Impact**: Complete platform compromise

#### 4. **Session Storage Vulnerabilities** (SEVERITY: MEDIUM)

## üìù CONCLUSION

The React SPA to Next.js migration represents a **significant architectural improvement** with modern development practices and well-structured component organization. However, the current implementation contains **CRITICAL PRODUCTION-BLOCKING VULNERABILITIES** that pose immediate security, performance, and legal compliance risks.

**The platform is NOT READY for production deployment** and requires a minimum of **4 weeks intensive remediation** before any deployment consideration.

While the business logic and user experience foundations are solid, the security vulnerabilities alone justify halting all deployment activities until comprehensive hardening is completed.

**Recommended Next Step**: Schedule emergency security review and begin immediate remediation of critical vulnerabilities identified in this report.
