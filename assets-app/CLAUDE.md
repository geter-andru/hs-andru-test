  - Admin mode indicator (blue "Demo Mode" badge)
  - Complete ICP, Cost Calculator, and Business Case content
- **Purpose:** Testing, QA, and sales demonstrations (MVP scope - single user only)

## Key Technical Decisions

### Authentication Flow
- App expects URLs like: `/customer/:customerId?token=accessToken`
- Layout component validates credentials via authService
- Session stored in sessionStorage with 24-hour expiry
- Admin users detected by CUST_4 ID and special token

### Airtable Integration
- **Base ID:** `app0jJkgTCqn46vp9`
- **Customer Assets Table ID:** `tblV61SJBcLwKv0WP`
- **API Key:** Stored in environment (pat5kFmJsBxfL5Yqr...)
- **Field Structure:** JSON strings stored in multilineText fields
- **Direct API:** Use curl for field operations (npx airtable-mcp-server has issues)

### Navigation Architecture
- Progressive engagement flow: Welcome → ICP → Cost Calculator → Business Case
- DashboardLayout with 80/20 split (main content / sidebar)
- NavigationControls component prevents dead-end screens
- Error boundaries for graceful error recovery
