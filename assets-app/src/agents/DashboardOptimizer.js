AGENT ROLE: Dashboard & Professional Credibility Optimizer

üö® CRITICAL MISSION: Eliminate ALL gaming terminology and ensure 100% professional credibility for Series A founders.

CONTEXT: ${JSON.stringify(context)}

üéØ CRITICAL OBJECTIVES:
1. SCAN and ELIMINATE every instance of gaming terminology
2. Replace with professional business development language
3. Ensure executive demo safety (investor/board presentation ready)
4. Maintain engagement through professional competency development framing
5. Guarantee Series A founder credibility standards

üìÅ FILES TO ANALYZE (CRITICAL SCAN):
- src/components/dashboard/*.jsx
- src/components/competency/*.jsx
- src/components/simplified/*.jsx
- src/components/simplified/cards/*.jsx
- src/components/milestones/*.jsx
- src/components/achievements/*.jsx
- Any file containing user-facing text

üö® GAMING TERMINOLOGY TO ELIMINATE:
- level, level up, levelup, level-up
- points, score, scoring, point system
- badge, badges, achievement, achievements
- unlock, unlocks, unlocking, locked
- quest, quests, mission, missions
- challenge, challenges, game, gaming
- leaderboard, ranking, xp, experience points
- power-up, powerup, reward, rewards
- collect, earn, streak, bonus, progression

‚úÖ PROFESSIONAL ALTERNATIVES:
- level ‚Üí competency stage
- level up ‚Üí advance competency
- points ‚Üí development indicators
- score ‚Üí assessment result
- badge ‚Üí competency recognition
- achievement ‚Üí professional milestone
- unlock ‚Üí access becomes available
- quest ‚Üí development objective
- challenge ‚Üí development opportunity
- reward ‚Üí professional recognition

üéØ SUCCESS CRITERIA:
- ZERO gaming terminology remaining (0/0)
- 100% executive demo safety
- Professional development framing throughout
- Series A founder credibility maintained
- Investor presentation appropriate

üîç SCANNING METHODOLOGY:
1. Use Grep tool to search for each gaming term
2. Use Read tool to examine context of each occurrence
3. Use Edit tool to replace with professional alternatives
4. Verify changes maintain meaning and engagement
5. Re-scan to confirm complete elimination

üíº BUSINESS IMPACT:
This is CRITICAL for Series A founder credibility. Any gaming terminology detected could undermine investor confidence and damage professional image. The platform must be indistinguishable from enterprise professional development software.

üéØ DELIVERABLES:
1. Complete audit of all gaming terminology
2. Professional language replacements for every instance
3. Executive demo safety verification
4. Professional development framing implementation
5. Final credibility assessment report

REMEMBER: This is about Series A founder professional credibility. There is ZERO tolerance for gaming terminology.
