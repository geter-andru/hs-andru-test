## Introduction

`@canva/cli` is a command line tool designed for creating and managing Canva Apps. Use `@canva/cli` to get started creating and testing your app. The Canva CLI allows you to create apps from the command line, and to use Canva's recommended development tools and templates.

To learn more about app development, visit [the official documentation](https://www.canva.dev/docs/apps).

## Requirements

Before using the CLI, make sure that you have the following:

- Node.js `v18.20.4` or `v20.17.0`.
- npm `v9` or `v10`.
- A [Canva account](https://www.canva.com/developers).

  **Note**: If you are using a version manager such as nvm, run the `nvm install 20.17.0` command to make sure you have the correct Node.js version.

## Quickstart

The following commands create a new Canva app using the Canva CLI.

```shell
npm install -g @canva/cli@latest
canva login
canva apps create "My New App" --template="hello_world" --distribution="public" --git --installDependencies
cd my-new-app
npm start
```

## Use the Canva CLI

### Step 1: Install and log in

Installing the Canva CLI allows you to create new apps from the command line.

To get started:

1. Install the Canva CLI globally.

   ```shell
   npm install -g @canva/cli@latest
   ```

2. Log in to the Canva CLI. The Canva CLI then opens an access request page in your browser.

   ```shell
   canva login
   ```

3. In your browser, click **Allow** to grant the Canva CLI access to create and edit apps on your behalf. When you grant access, the Canva CLI generates an auth token and stores it locally. For more information on the auth token, read the following section on [auth token storage and removal](#log-out-auth-token-storage-and-removal).
4. Copy the confirmation code shown in your browser, and paste it into the Canva CLI input.

### Step 2: Create your app

After you log in to the Canva CLI and authorize it, you can create your app.

To create a new app:

1. Run the `canva apps create` command. The flags in the following code snippet are optional, and you can instead configure these settings during the apps creation process. See the [CLI Reference](#cli-reference) for more information on each flag.

   ```shell
   canva apps create "My New App" --template="hello_world" --distribution="public" --git --installDependencies
   ```

   **Note**: You can't change the distribution type after creating an app.

### Step 3: Preview your app

When your new app is ready, the Canva CLI automatically opens the [Developer Portal](https://www.canva.com/developers/apps) to your new app's Configuration page in your browser. You can then continue to preview and manage your new app.

To preview your app:

1. Change into your new app's folder.

   ```shell
   cd my-new-app
   ```

2. Run the following command to start your app.

   ```shell
   npm start
   ```

3. The preview URL will be generated and opened automatically in your browser.
4. If this is the first time previewing your app, click **Open** to preview your new app.

### Step 4: Run a health check on your app

After creating your app, you can diagnose potential issues using:

```shell
canva apps doctor
```

This checks for missing dependencies, outdated packages, and other issues.

## Log out, auth token storage, and removal

When you log in to the Canva CLI using the `canva login` command, and then grant the Canva CLI access to manage apps in your Canva account, an auth token is encrypted and stored locally on your machine. The token provides authentication for future requests so you don't need to grant the Canva CLI access each time it sends a request.

When you log out of the Canva CLI with the `canva logout` command, the auth token is revoked, and deleted.

### Token Location

The auth token is located in your home directory under the `.canva-cli` folder.

### Removing the Token

To delete the token, there are two options. However, only the `canva logout` command revokes and deletes the token. If there's a copy of the token, it's possible to reconnect the Canva CLI to your account's apps using the token.

#### Log out

1. Use the `canva logout` command to revoke access and delete the stored token.

   ```shell
   canva logout
   ```

#### Delete the file manually

1. Locate the `credentials` file, which is stored in the following locations:
   - **macOS and Linux**: The token is stored in `~/.canva-cli/credentials`.
   - **Windows**: The token is stored in `%USERPROFILE%\.canva-cli\credentials`.

2. Delete the file.
